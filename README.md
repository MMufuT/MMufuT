## Hey, I'm Mufu!

📚 I'm Currently a Rising Senior @ Case Western Reserve University pursuing a B.S. Degree in Computer Science

### ☀️ This Summer, I'm interning as:
- A Software Development Team Lead for Our National Conversation
- A Software Engineering Research Intern for the University of Louisville
---
### Some of my hobbies include:
---
#### ⌨️ Programming (Obviously 😭)
- 🌱 I'm currently working on a chrome-extension bookmark folder synchronization tool using GoLang and WebRTC that boosts productivty/orginization within teams by allowing them to share bookmarks across browsers in real time
- 🌱 I'm also building a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@moof108) for fun that revolves around my programming journey (LeetCode, Program w/ Me, etc.)
- 🌳 ([emailaifilter.com](https://emailaifilter.com/) I built an ai-powered search engine for your emails that queries emails based on email context rather than traditional keyword-based search
- 🌲 (cwru-autoenroll) I built an SMS notification equipped tool that auto enrolls CWRU students into any fully occupied courses in their shopping cart as soon as they open up via someone unenrolling. SMS notifications are sent based on various cases (class pre-reqs not met, succesfully enrolled, etc.)
